### Schizobot / INTERNALS / Artificial Conscience
* "Conscience" here is not merely limited to the common understanding that it is an ability to tell the difference between what is "right" and what is "wrong";
* Here, conscience is a much richer and more nuanced, varied set of concepts;
* In essence, it is in many ways the faculties of judgment in general ("in abstracto");
* That is, in a moral judgment of the "rightness" or "wrongness" of some "intention act" (of "free will", presumably!), the concepts - for they are concepts! - of "right" vs. "wrong" are treated merely as more or less arbitrary "values";
* In this case, we have a binary choice between two alternatives, which could be computed as a Boolean function, yes/no, right/wrong, up/down, left/right, etc.;
* As we will show, moral judgment and moral reasoning cannot truly be reduced to such binary choices;
* The realm of what is "moral" or "ethical" is much subtler and much more complex than that, for often there are contradictions and paradoxes that come to be, where things CANNOT simply be represented in black and white terms;
* For that is the true "moral question", i.e. it is never just a question of what is right vs. what is wrong, but is the critical, "moral-philosophic" treatment and study of the case-at-hand (which in our terms is always a unique special case event or phenomenon);
* Therefore, the research problem/question of the construction of an "Artificial Conscience" must begin with a proper treatment of the moral-philosophic underpinnings of the questions of conscience, moral reasoning, moral judgment, judgment in general, etc.;
* "Two key elements of an individual are the possibility of it observing its own mental processes, and of monitoring them according to his moral principles." (p. 21-22, Jacques Pitratauth, "Artificial Beings: The Conscience of a Conscious Machine");
